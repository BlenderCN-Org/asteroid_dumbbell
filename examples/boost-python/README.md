## C++ in Python

This will be using [Boost Python](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html) to interface C++ into Python.

## Setup

1. You need Boost. Which is probably already installed. But can also be installed from source [here](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html)

~~~
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
~~~

2. The Boost-Python library is not installed by default. Again can build from source [here](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/libs/python/doc/building.html) or the package, usually outdated.

~~~
sudo apt-get install libboost-python
~~~

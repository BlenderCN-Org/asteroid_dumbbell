## Keyframe format

The keyframe format is the same the TUM RGB dataset, which is defined [here](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/file_formats).

The documentation that shows that that ORB-SLAM format is in fact following this guideline is given at this [comment](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2/issues/12).

Ground-truth trajectories

We provide the groundtruth trajectory as a text file containing the translation and orientation of the camera in a fixed coordinate frame. Note that also our automatic evaluation tool expects both the groundtruth and estimated trajectory to be in this format.

Each line in the text file contains a single pose.
The format of each line is 'timestamp tx ty tz qx qy qz qw'
* timestamp (float) gives the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.

* tx ty tz (3 floats) give the position of the optical center of the color camera with respect to the world origin as defined by the motion capture system.

* qx qy qz qw (4 floats) give the orientation of the optical center of the color camera in form of a unit quaternion with respect to the world origin as defined by the motion capture system.

The file may contain comments that have to start with “#”.

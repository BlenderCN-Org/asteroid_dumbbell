## Purpose

This directory holds several large mat files that contain the data used to test 
the energy behavior of the inertial equations of motion of a dumbbell spacecraft
around an asteroid.

The inertial equations of motion are defined in `dynamics/ast_eoms_inertial.`

## Usage

The driver script that generates this data is in 
`dynamics/inertial_eoms_energy_behavior.m`


## Results

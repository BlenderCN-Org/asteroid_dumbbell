## Reconstruction data

* `20180330_castalia_mesh_incremental_reconstruction.hdf5` - Data generated from `dissertation.reconstruction_plots.castalia_reconstruct_generate_data`

    The reconstruction example is from an initial ellipsoid with semi-axes the same size as Castalia.
    The vertex measurements come from the true shape model of Castalia.
    The vertices are sorted according to increasing x component and added one at a time to modify the mesh.
    All the plots can be generated by using `dissertation.reconstruction.castalia_generate_plots`

* `20180414_castalia_reconstruction_example.hdf5` - Generated from dissertation/reconstruction_plots.py

    Some example reconstruction using the points of the true asteroid model and C++ for mesh update
